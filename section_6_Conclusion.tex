Obtain a single solution from PMAO not straightforward and future direction



%In this paper, we addressed some research questions of NWAA regarding the base location and team configuration of their RRVs to maximise their impact. 
%We modelled the problem as a special case of the Capacitated Multi-facility Weber Problem (CMWP) and developed a robust matheuristic approach along with a large number of realistic problem instances. We developed an efficient matheuristic method by combining heuristic and exact techniques in a way that can generate high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. The close proximity of the obtained base locations on the map across 100 different instances indicates our approach's robustness. Finally, upon careful examination of the obtained outputs for different scenarios, we provided our observations/recommendations.

%It is important to note that, in our analysis, we use the past incident data. If there is a significant change that affects the incident distribution or count in the region (e.g., Covid-19 Pandemic), these effects could be different. In our analysis, we tried our best and use what is available to us. Having said that, if the demand changes (more likely during a pandemic) but the distribution does not change (less likely during a pandemic), the locations we have identified will still improve the total flight distance and time but less or more depending on the change in demand levels. However, from another angle, after some real-life data are available for a new scenario, our data processing pipeline could be useful in such cases through which we can produce realistic instances to run our method thereon for more realistic output.

%We have not analysed how much NWAA could gain/lose if they use specific locations for a given team composition since the number of options could be infinitely many. However, given extra information about the candidate scenarios for base locations and team compositions, we can conduct these additional analyses for NWAA. Currently, we are devising a hyper-heuristic based framework to improve the solution generation process further. We are also working to optimise the operations of rapid response vehicles of NWAA, which is a more complicated task than what we addressed here.

%Although depending on the data source and filtering used, our models suggested different base locations, in almost all of the cases, the base locations are located in areas with highly populated city centres in the south of the region, Manchester and Liverpool. If there is a third option of base, this is usually located area around Preston or Lancaster. Although more bases are always better than fewer bases, if only one of the three teams is only contains a doctor, the average travel time improvement from having from two bases to three bases is around 5\%. For the cases with teams of two or three doctors we see percent improvements of 15 and 29\% respectively.
