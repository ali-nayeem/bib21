\abstract{Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a prerequisite for several analyses in bioinformatics such as phylogeny estimation, protein structure prediction, etc. PASTA is a state-of-the-art method for computing MSAs well-known for its accuracy and scalability. It iteratively co-estimates both MSA and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree. It attempts to exploit the close association between the accuracy of an MSA and the corresponding tree in finding
the output through multiple iterations from both directions. Currently, PASTA uses the ML score as its optimization criteria which is a good score in phylogeny estimation but cannot be proven as a necessary and sufficient criterion to produce the true phylogenetic tree. Therefore the integration of multiple application-aware objectives, carefully chosen considering better association to the tree accuracy, into PASTA may potentially have a profound positive impact on its performance. This paper employed four application-aware objectives alongside ML score to develop a multi-objective (MO) framework, namely, PMAO, that leverage PASTA to generate a tree-space of alternative trees. We analyzed this tree-space based on the tree generated by PASTA by experimenting on a popular biological benchmark and found that the tree-space contains significantly better trees than PASTA. To help the domain expert finding the most appropriate tree, we showed that PMAO framework could be assisted by an appropriate machine learning approach to generate a few solutions, among whom at least one is of high quality. We attempted to obtain a single high-quality solution without using any external evidence. We found that summarizing the few solutions detected through machine learning can serve this purpose to some extent. \\
