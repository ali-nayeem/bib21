\abstract{Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a prerequisite for several bioinformatics analysis such as phylogeny estimation, protein structure prediction, etc. PASTA is a state-of-the-art method for computing MSAs well-known for its accuracy and scalability. It iteratively co-estimates both MSA and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree. It attempts to exploit the close association between the
accuracy of an MSA and the corresponding tree in finding
the output through multiple iterations from both directions. Currently PASTA uses the ML score as its optimization criteria which is a good score in the context of phylogeny estimation but cannot be proven as a necessary and sufficient criterion to produce the true phylogenetic tree. Therefore the integration of multiple appplication-aware objectives, carefully chosen considering better association to the tree accuracy, into PASTA may potentially have a profound positive impact on its performance. This paper employed four application-aware objectives alongside ML score to develop a multi-objective framework, namely, PMAO, that leverage PASTA to generate a tree-space of alternative trees. We analyzed this tree-space with respect to the tree generated by PASTA, by experimenting on a popular biological benchmark, and found that the tree-space contains significantly better trees than PASTA. To help the domain expert finding the most appropriate tree, we showed that PMAO can be assisted by machine learning approach to generate a few solutions among whom at least one is of high quality. We explore different ways to obtain a single high quality solution without using any external evidence and found that summarizing (to be completed after finalizing the results section). \\
