\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Option 1: Maximize the count of the covered incidents according to Euclidean/Manhattan distance measure
	
	\item Option 2: Maximize the sum of ISS scores of the covered incidents according to Euclidean/Manhattan distance measure
	
	\item  Option 3: A bi-objective formulation where two conflicting objectives are simultaneously optimized.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Maximize Coverage: Total covered incidents according to Euclidean/Manhattan distance measure.
		
		\item Minimize Distance: Sum of the distances (Euclidean/Manhattan) of all covered incidents from the closest candidate base.
		
		
	\end{enumerate}
